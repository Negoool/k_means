# k_means
implementing k means clustering with analytical tools
Cluster Wikipedia documents using k-means
    initial cluster centers
    assign observations to the closet cluster center
    revise cluster centers 
    repeat until convergence
Visualizing the results of clustering
Assesing the quality of clustering( hetergeneity = sum of squared distance between  data points and cluster centers assigned to them)
exploring the role of initialization and intrucing a smart initialization
explore how results will differ by changing number of clusters
